         <dl><dt><b>My hobby</b></dt>
		 <dd><p>
	          One of my favorite my most favorite hobbies would have to be traveling! I absolutely travelled all places around the Nepal. 
		       Traveling allows me to admire what I call the beauty of nature. Traveling is my favorite hobby because it allows me to escape my everyday responsibilities. 
             I love to travel with friends but, I've also always been the type that would catch a flight just to get away alone if necessary. 
             That's what I call fun haha,The excitement of going to another places gives me a sense of happiness. 										
             I've been to a couple different states and I've taken a few different cruises.</dd>
